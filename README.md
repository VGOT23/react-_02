Perfect — you’ve got a new task here: a **React UI for books with search, add, and remove functionality**. I’ll give you a clean **README.md** you can ship along with the code.

### `README.md`

```markdown
# React Book List App

A simple React application that demonstrates how to build an interactive UI with **search**, **add**, and **remove** functionality using React state and props.

---

## 📄 Description
This project displays a list of books (each with a **title** and **author**).  
It includes the following features:
- **Search**: Filter books by title or author as the user types.
- **Add**: Add a new book using the input form (title + author).
- **Remove**: Delete any book from the list with a button click.

All actions update the UI dynamically without reloading the page, showcasing React’s state management.

## 🖥️ Example

### Initial Book List

* **The Great Gatsby** — F. Scott Fitzgerald
* **To Kill a Mockingbird** — Harper Lee

### Features

* Typing "Harper" in the search box filters the list to show only Harper Lee’s book.
* Adding `"1984" by George Orwell` immediately updates the displayed list.
* Clicking **Remove** beside a book deletes it instantly.

## 🎨 Customization

* Modify the initial `books` array in `App.jsx` to change the default list.
* Extend the `BookItem` component to show more details (e.g., year, genre).
* Add local storage to persist books across page reloads.
